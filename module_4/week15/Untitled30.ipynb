        "\n",
        "Welcome! This notebook will guide you through building your very first deep learning algorithm, the **Perceptron**, from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perceptrons were one of the first algorithms discovered in the field of AI. Their significance was that they raised the hopes and expectations for the field of neural networks. A Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm that uses a single node (or \"neuron\") to predict a class label for a row of data. It's the simplest possible type of neural network.\n",

        "### The Four Components of a Perceptron\n",
        "\n",
        "A Perceptron has four main parts. Think of it as a simple decision-making process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Input Values ($x$):** This is your data. For example, in our case, we'll have two input values, `x1` and `x2`.\n",
        "2.  **Weights ($w$) and Bias ($b$):**\n",
        "    * **Weights:** Each input value has a corresponding \"weight\". A weight represents how important that input is for the final decision. A bigger weight means that input matters more.\n",
        "    * **Bias:** The bias is an extra value that helps the model make a decision.\n",
        "    * *Learning* is simply the process of finding the perfect set of weights and bias.\n",
        "3.  **Net Sum ($z$):** This is the first calculation the Perceptron does. It multiplies each input by its weight, sums them all up, and then adds the bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "    $z = (x_1 \\cdot w_1) + (x_2 \\cdot w_2) + ... + b$\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Activation Function:** This is the final step. The Perceptron takes the `Net Sum` ($z$) and passes it through a simple function to make a final, binary decision (0 or 1).\n",
        "    * The simplest activation function is a **step function**:\n",
        "    * If the `Net Sum` ($z$) is greater than 0, predict **1**.\n",
        "    * Otherwise, predict **0**."
