''' Python Operators
    Operators are symbols in Python that perform operations on variables and values. Here, we will focus on;
        Compairson Operators
        Assignment Operators
        Logical Operators

# # Comparison Operators
# # Comparison operators are used to compare two values. The result is always True or False.
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a == b)       # False
# print(a != b)       # True
# print(a > b)        # False
# print(a < b)        # True
# print(a >= 10)      # True
# print(b <= 25)      # True

# # Use case example - Student Exam Result
# score = 75
# print(score >= 50)      # True (Passed)
# print(score <= 50)      # False (Failed)
# print(score == 100)     # False (Not full marks)

# # Assignment Operators
# # Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also combine an operatio with assignment, so instead of writing x = x + 5, we can write x += 5.
# x = 10
# print("Initial value:", x)
# x += 5
# print("After x+=5", x)
# x -= 2
# print("After x -= 2:", x)
# x *= 3
# print("After x *= 3:", x)
# x /= 4
# print("After x /4:", x)
# x %= 3
# print("After x %= 3:", x)

# x = 4
# x **= 2
# print("After x **= 2:", x)

# x //=3
# print("After x //=3 3:", x)

# # Use case Example:
# # Define variables
# balance = 1000
# deposit = 200
# withdraw = 150

# balance += deposit      # Add deposit
# balance -= withdraw     # Subtract withdrawal

# print("Updated Balance:", balance)

# # Logical Operators
# # Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They work with Boolean values (True or False).
# x = 10
# y = 20

# # and operator
# print(x > 5 and y > 15)         # True

# # or operator
# print(x < 5 or y > 15)          # True

# # not operator
# print(not(x == 10))              # False

# # Use case example1 - Scholarship Eligibility
# # Define variables
# age = 17
# score = 85

# # Must be younger than 18 AND score above 80
# eligible = (age < 18) and (score > 80)
# print("Scholarship Eligible:", eligible)

# # Use case example 2 - Event Access
# age = 22
# has_ticket = False

# can_enter = (age >= 18) and (has_ticket or age < 25)
# print("Access Granted:", can_enter)     # Output: Access Granted: True (because age < 25 even without ticket)
