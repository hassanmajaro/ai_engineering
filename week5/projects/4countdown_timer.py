"""
A countdown timer is a simple yet useful
application that counts down from a specified number of
seconds and notifies the user when the time reaches zero.
This project improves understanding of loops, time
management, and user input handling in Python.
This project covers the step-by-step implementation of a
countdown timer, user input handling, time-based
execution, and displaying the remaining time.

Key Concepts of Countdown Timer in Python

Time Handling:

- Using the time module
- Implementing delays with time.sleep()

User Input Handling:

- Taking input for the countdown duration
- Validating input format

Loops and Conditional Statements:

-0 Using a while loop to decrement the
timer
- Displaying the remaining time at
intervals
